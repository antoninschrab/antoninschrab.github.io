This July, I've had the great pleasure of participating in the [Conference on Learning Theory COLT 2022](http://learningtheory.org/colt2022/) which has been held in person in London! 
I found the conference to be a real success, it was wonderful to finally be able to meet so many people sharing the same interests in learning theory!
The conference was held in the historic [Royal Institution of Great Britain](https://venue.rigb.org) which is the location of the famous televised [Christmas Lectures](https://www.rigb.org/christmas-lectures).

The conference kicked off with a [joint workshop](https://bguedj.github.io/colt-ims-2022.github.io/) between [COLT](http://learningtheory.org/colt2022/) and [IMS (Institute of Mathematical Statistics) Annual Meeting](https://www.imsannualmeeting-london2022.com) with tutorials and talks by [Emmanuel Cand√®s](https://candes.su.domains/), [Nati Srebro](https://home.ttic.edu/~nati/) and [Vladimir Vovk](http://www.vovk.net/) on the topics of conformal prediction and mathematics of deep learning.
This workshop allowed to bring together both audience (IMS and COLT) with aligned interests on statistics and learning theory. 
This was a great initiative which was really appreciated by all the participants I talked to, I hope the joint workshop between IMS and COLT will remain in future editions of the conferences!

During the four next days, all papers accepted to COLT 2022 have been presented by the authores. Each talk was ten minutes long, this format allowed to get a good overview of each of the 155 papers. Topics included Online Learning, Statistics, Privacy, Robustness, Computational Complexity, Deep Learning, Generalization, Bandits, Sampling, Optimization, Graphs, Information Theory, Reinforcement Learning and Control.
