<!--
I am a Senior Research Associate at [Cambridge University](https://www.cam.ac.uk) ([Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk)). 
-->
I work on kernel hypothesis testing with applications to Machine Learning.
See [here](https://antoninschrab.github.io/interests/) for detailed research interests and [here](https://antoninschrab.github.io/bio/) for a short biography.

I have completed my PhD on the [Foundational Artifical Intelligence CDT](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/study/foundational-artificial-intelligence-mphilphd) (2020-2025) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk), supervised by [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io) at the [UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/) and [Inria London](https://london.inria.fr), and by [Arthur Gretton](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/) at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/).

I also received a [Master of Science in Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/postgraduate-taught/machine-learning-msc) (2019-2020) from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) and a [Master of Mathematics](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/which-course/mathematics) (2014-2018) from the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk).
