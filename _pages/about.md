<!--I am a PhD student on the [Foundational Artifical Intelligence CDT](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/study/foundational-artificial-intelligence-mphilphd) working on PAC-Bayes and kernel methods with [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io) at the [UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/) and [Arthur Gretton](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/) at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/).
My research interests lie in proving theoretical guarantees for various machine learning algorithms such as kernel-based aggregated testing procedures, stochastic gradient descent for training deep neural networks, etc.
I received a [Master of Mathematics](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/which-course/mathematics) from the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk) and a [Master of Science in Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/postgraduate-taught/machine-learning-msc) from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).
I am also affiliated with [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) and the [Modal research team](https://team.inria.fr/modal/).-->

I am a PhD student on the [Foundational Artifical Intelligence CDT](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/study/foundational-artificial-intelligence-mphilphd) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk), supervised by [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io) at the [UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/) and [Arthur Gretton](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/) at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/).

My research interests include kernel methods, PAC-Bayes and generative models. 
I have recently focused on proving theoretical guarantees for kernel-based aggregated testing procedures.

Prior to starting my PhD, I received a [Master of Mathematics](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/which-course/mathematics) from the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk) and a [Master of Science in Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/postgraduate-taught/machine-learning-msc) from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).

I am affiliated with [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) through the [Inria-London Programme](http://london.inria.fr/) and the [Modal research team](https://team.inria.fr/modal/).
I organise the [DeepMind/ELLIS CSML Seminar Series](https://ucl-ellis.github.io/dm_csml_seminar_home/) for the [UCL ELLIS Unit](https://ucl-ellis.github.io).
