I am a PhD student on the [Foundational Artifical Intelligence CDT](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/study/foundational-artificial-intelligence-mphilphd) (2020-2024) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk), supervised by [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io) at the [UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/) and [Arthur Gretton](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/) at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/).

My research, lying at the intersection of the machine learning, statistics and computer science communities, has currently focused on designing kernel-based hypothesis tests for the two-sample, independence and goodness-of-fit problems.
A unique aspect of my work is that an equally strong emphasis is put on both theory and practicality, which is of the utmost importance for the real-world uses of these tests.
Indeed, strong theoretical guarantees in terms of minimax optimality are provided, and much effort has been put into providing user-friendly parameter-free [implementations](https://github.com/antoninschrab/) of all proposed tests with the ability to leverage GPU architectures for significant computational speedups.
This practical aim to construct parameter-free tests for users resulted in a common theme throughout my research: tackling the fundamental problem of kernel selection for kernel-based hypothesis tests, either via Aggregation, or via Fusion.
A nowadays very common concern that could affect the adoption of these tests for real-world applications is privacy of sensitive data, as such, we have recently proposed tests with differential privacy guarantees, have proved their minimax optimality, and have released publicly available [code](https://github.com/antoninschrab/dpkernel).

I have also always had a keen interest in generative modelling and have kept close to that community.

Prior to starting my PhD, I received a [Master of Mathematics](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/which-course/mathematics) from the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk) and a [Master of Science in Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/postgraduate-taught/machine-learning-msc) from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).

I am affiliated with [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) through the [Inria-London Programme](http://london.inria.fr/) and the [Modal research team](https://team.inria.fr/modal/).
I also organise the [DeepMind/ELLIS CSML Seminar Series](https://ucl-ellis.github.io/dm_csml_seminar_home/) on Computational Statistics and Machine Learning for the [UCL ELLIS Unit](https://ucl-ellis.github.io) (European Lab for Learning & Intelligent Systems).
